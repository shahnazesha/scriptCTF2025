# The Insider 2 | NoobMaster

    Description: You found out the insider, but can you find what they leaked on GitHub and put it to use?

# Write-up

Visiting NoobMaster's github (linked in his discord), we found a "creds" repo with a username and password. Reading his discord about me gives a link of a CTFd user, and https://2026.scriptsorcerers.xyz is set as his website! Going to this website, its the planning for scriptCTF 2026! You can login and get the flag!
